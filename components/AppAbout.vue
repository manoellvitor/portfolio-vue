        I&apos;m Manoel Lopes, a passionate Software Test Engineer with over 5
        years of experience specializing in quality assurance and test
        automation. I thrive on crafting reliable, scalable testing solutions
        that enhance software performance and ensure exceptional user
        experiences. My expertise spans across tools like Playwright, Cypress,
        Selenium, and Postman, and I&apos;m fluent in JavaScript, TypeScript,
        and Python. With a solid foundation in both manual and automated testing
        across APIs, web apps, and robotics systems, I bring a detail-oriented,
        Agile-driven approach to every project. Let&apos;s build better
        software—one test at a time. On a personal note, I&apos;m an Inline
        Hockey enthusiast 🏒 and a devoted fan of Harry Potter ⚡ and Lord of
        the Rings 🌄.
